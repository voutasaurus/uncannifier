## Restricting API keys

On my google account, when creating an API key in the Google Developers
Console, the dropdown to set API restrictions on the generated API key was
nonfunctional. Specifically when clicked on, it reacted by being highlighted
but did not expand (i.e. drop down) or display any options.

The API key record appears with a warning sign which indicates that the
recommended restrictions have not been applied.

So I decided instead to create a new google account to segregate this API key
from controlling my personal Google account (the alternative is nightmarish).

When I created this account and an API key the restrictions drop down dropped
down on click, but was missing the YouTube API as an option. I then discovered
that the YouTube API needs to be enabled for a project before an API key can be
restricted to YouTube only. So I did that. And now I have an API key that can
be restricted.
